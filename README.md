##Project Title

Meal Your Goals

#Project Description

Create a meal planning app that suggests recipes based on ingredients and provides nutritional information for each recipe. 

##User Story

As a busy individual who wants to eat healthier and save time, I want a meal planning app that suggests recipes based on the ingredients I have and provides nutritional information for each recipe, so that I can easily plan nutritious meals and make informed choices without having to search for recipes or calculate nutritional values manually.

#Acceptance Criteria

Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggestions

When I input ingredients I currently have on hand, the app should suggest a list of recipes that use those ingredients.
The app should prioritize recipes that use the majority of the ingredients I input.
I should be able to add or remove ingredients to refine the suggested recipes list.
Nutritional Information

For each recipe suggested, the app should provide a breakdown of key nutritional information, including calories, protein, fats, carbohydrates, and other relevant nutrients.
I should be able to see nutritional information per serving and for the entire recipe.
Meal Planning Features

I can add suggested recipes to a weekly meal plan, organized by day and meal (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).
The app should calculate and display the total nutritional information for each dayâ€™s planned meals.
I can adjust serving sizes or substitute ingredients, and the app will update nutritional information accordingly.
Shopping List Generation

The app should allow me to generate a shopping list of missing ingredients based on my planned recipes for the week.
I should be able to adjust quantities of ingredients on the list and mark items as purchased.
User Profile & Dietary Preferences

The app should let me set dietary preferences and restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, low-carb), which will filter recipe suggestions accordingly.
My profile should allow me to save favorite recipes and track my weekly nutritional goals based on meal plans.

#APIs to be used

Recipe API (Edamam or Spoonacular) to fetch recipes based on ingredients. 

Nutrition API (USDA FoodData Central or Nutrionix) to calculate nutritional values.

##Directions (Improvements)

The app could recommend recipes based on my past selections or dietary goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain).
I should be able to give feedback on recipes, allowing the app to improve future suggestions.
